Description: ## Code style

        ### Python
        We adopt [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) as the preferred code style.

        We use the following tools for linting and formatting:
        - [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/): linter
        - [yapf](https://github.com/google/yapf): formatter
        - [isort](https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort): sort imports

        Style configurations of yapf and isort can be found in [setup.cfg](../setup.cfg).

        We use [pre-commit hook](https://pre-commit.com/) that checks and formats for `flake8`, `yapf`, `isort`, `trailing whitespaces`,
         fixes `end-of-files`, sorts `requirments.txt` automatically on every commit.
        The config for a pre-commit hook is stored in [.pre-commit-config](../.pre-commit-config.yaml).

        After you clone the repository, you will need to install initialize pre-commit hook.

        ```
        pip install -U pre-commit
        ```

        From the repository folder
        ```
        pre-commit install
        ```

        After this on every commit check code linters and formatter will be enforced.
